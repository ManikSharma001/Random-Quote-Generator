# Random-Quote-Generator
This program creates an app, where you can press a button, and it will randomly generate a quote! Uses the Python Kivy framework. Also included is a window's executable file that was made using PyInstaller. Also, I used a Python Virtual Environment to create this app.

On August 29, 2022: Added the web scraping version which gets quotes from the following online website: https://www.shopify.ca/blog/motivational-quotes. To use the webscraping version, the files scrape.py and main_scrape.py must be used. To use the old version which contains the quotes embedded in the program (good for offline use), please use main.py.
